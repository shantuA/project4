        <h1>PYTHON</h1>
        <H2>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
             Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
             significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
              It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented
               and functional programming</H2>
